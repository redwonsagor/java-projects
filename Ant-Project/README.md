# Ant Project

An object-oriented **Java GUI application** built in **Eclipse**, demonstrating **design patterns** and **UML-based design**.  
The project simulates an ant colony where ants can have different **colors, sizes, and poses**, with the ability to apply decorators such as hats, bowties, or eye colors.
